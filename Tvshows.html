<h1>Favorite Tv Shows</h1>
<h2>My favorite current show is "The Flash" on Cw. The show is very good and I am also a comic fan.</h2>

<h2>One of my other favorite shows is comes from the Dc universe again and it is Gotham. This show is a prequel to batman himself. It shows the pure corruption that Gotham has subcome to and tells the story of a young Bruce Wayne making his way to becoming the bat.</h2>
